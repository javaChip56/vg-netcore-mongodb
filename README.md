# DotNet Core Demo
- This project is a work in progress. It aims to demonstrate basic dotnet core WebAPI hosted on an Ubuntu VM (Bionic).
- This project loads everything using a Vagrantfile which installs all the pre-requisites.

# Optional Installs
These applications are fully optional to be installed on your development machine.
These are only required in order to host the MongoDB database and Docker engine used in this demo.
- Vagrant v2.2.5 from [Vagrant's website](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- Virtualbox v6.0.12 from [Oracle Virtualbox Older Builds](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_6_0)

To run this demo without installing the above applications, these are required to be on the developer machines.
- MongoDB Server.
- .Net Core 2.2 Runtime, SDK and Hosting. .Net 3.0 will work as well but requires some changes on the application.

# Current State:
- Runs Ubuntu Bionic in Virtualbox provisioned via Vagrant.
- Installs Docker inside the guest VM. Then pulls and builds the MongoDB database.
- Sets up the sample databases and tables. The database will be exposed to the host machine on port 27020.
- Runs 1 containerized .NET Core API called ClientAPI with basic get functions to fetch data from MongoDB database.

# Todos
- Centralized Logging.
- Upgrade to dotNet Core 3.0.

# Important Information!
Vagrant conflicts with Hyper-V
----
If you have Docker installed on your Development machine, you'll need to disable Hyper-V for Vagrant to work. 

In some cases, you may still encounter VT-x error even when you've already enable Virtualization in your BIOS. To deal with this, run the code below on an Administrator command prompt. Then reboot your computer. Note: This setting may be reset by Group Policies.

```
bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
```

Vagrant SSH: Permission denied (publickey)
----
Running ```vagrant ssh -- -vv``` will show you that this error pertains to Windows SSH thinking the Vagrant private is not secured or "too open".

To work around this, locate the private_key file generated when you run ```vagrant up```, then only grant your current Windows user account and remove any inherited permissions by going to the files ```Properties > Security > Advanced Security Settings (using the Edit button)```.
